an algorithm and
an implementation by which generalized rules for simplication are auto??
matically induced from annotated training material with a novel partial

formation This algorithm described in the paper employs example??based
generalizations on linguistically??motivated structures

semi-automatically?

one sent at a time, discourse related issues not considered (like me!); two-stage process -- analysis followed by transformation: structural description, used to perform actual simplification

they don't use a full parse, rather, identify certain "articulation points" -- chunked into phrasal representations; they can induce rules automatically, but they need annotated aligned corpus of complex and simple text.
their "gap-filling" routine (like replace "the ball was kicked" with "someone kicked the ball") is complicated/based on pragmatic factors, not discussed

use combined constituent and dep repr's, based on simple dep repr from LTAG -- supertags are elementary trees, with multiple ones associated with each lexical entry, corresponding to types of complex sentences; they don't parse to disambiguate supertags, rather use n-gram distribution info from LTAG'd corpus
